        </p>

        <p>It currently differs from the book as lines are rendered in parallel for speed. My
        design allows for multiple different anti-aliasing techniques (though only two are implented
        right now, and I may rethink the code structure).

        <p>I will likely return to this project after writing a raytracer in a different language, this
        project hit a wall as early design decisions didn't fully account for future additions. I'll probably
        rewrite it at some point, implementing metals, dielectrics, camera manipulation, and defocus blur.

        </div>

        <p>After being nerd-sniped by a by a tweet, I went about writing an interpreter for the
        esoteric programming language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank">Brainfuck</a>.
        I decided to use C and currently it can be built with the Zig build system or GNU Make with GCC.
        </p>

        <p>Memory is dynamically allocated, so if the data pointer attempts to move out of the currently allocated region of data,
        memory will be reallocated to accomodate.

        <p>After a while of no luck debugging, I finally fixed an issue that meant the interpreter was
        skipping past more <code>]</code> instructions than it should have. So here's some cool
        programs running:

        <p>In an attempt to learn the Zig programming language, I decided to create a basic HTTP server.
        </p>
        
        <p>It currently only crudely implements the <code>GET</code> method, but I've been able to locally host

        <p>Oxalis (named after a flower affected by the rust fungi) is [going to be] a real-time

        <h3>2024-06-11 - Rewrite</h3>
        <p>I wasn't sure on the structure of the first attempt and so began a rewrite, though I might
        sideline this project for a while.
        </p>

        <h3>2025-01-28 - Note</h3>
        <p>I am still planning on getting back around to writing this, but it might be a while as I'm
        busy with other projects and work.
